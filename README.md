# ProofLayer
**ProofLayer is a Sui-native platform for verifiable security, research, and skill contributions.**  
It enables organizations to fund real work, contributors to submit protected artefacts, and rewards plus reputation to be distributed transparently on-chain.

##  Problem Statement
Across cybersecurity, research, and technical fields, people produce valuable work such as:
- Security reports and audits  
- Research datasets and experiments  
- Technical write-ups and findings  

However, there is no trusted, privacy-preserving way to:
- **Prove ownership** of contributed work  
- **Secure sensitive data** during review  
- **Verify contributions** transparently  
- **Reward contributors** fairly  
- **Build portable proof of skill** beyond CVs  

As a result:
- Contributors lack recognition and incentives  
- Organizations struggle to trust external submissions  
- Sensitive data is often mishandled or siloed  
This is a **coordination and trust problem**, not just a tooling problem.


## Solution
**ProofLayer** provides a decentralized coordination layer where:
- Organizations, labs, or teams create **funded contribution pools**
- Contributors submit **real security or research work**
- Submissions are:
  - Stored immutably using **Walrus**
  - Encrypted and access-controlled using **Seal**
  - Linked on-chain to the contributor as a verifiable object
- Pool owners review and approve submissions
- **Rewards are distributed automatically on Sui**
- Each accepted contribution builds an **on-chain contributor profile**

This bridges:
- **Security & research infrastructure**
- **Skill & data coordination**
- **Security & research infrastructure**
- **Skill & data coordination**
