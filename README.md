# ProofLayer

**ProofLayer is a Sui-native platform for verifiable security, research, and skill contributions.**  
It enables organizations to fund real work, contributors to submit protected artefacts, and rewards plus reputation to be distributed transparently on-chain.

##  Problem Statement
Across cybersecurity, research, and technical fields, people produce valuable work such as:
- Security reports and audits  
- Research datasets and experiments  
- Technical write-ups and findings  

However, there is no trusted, privacy-preserving way to:
- **Prove ownership** of contributed work  
- **Secure sensitive data** during review  
- **Verify contributions** transparently  
- **Reward contributors** fairly  
- **Build portable proof of skill** beyond CVs  

As a result:
- Contributors lack recognition and incentives  
- Organizations struggle to trust external submissions  
- Sensitive data is often mishandled or siloed  
This is a **coordination and trust problem**, not just a tooling problem.
